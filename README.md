# Understanding Regional Music Preferences: South Korea ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡· vs. USA

## Project Overview

This project aims to compare music trends in South Korea and the USA using data from Spotify's Top 50 charts. The goal is to understand differences in local vs. global music preferences, artist distribution, and popularity scores to derive actionable insights for streaming platforms and advertisers.

## Market Context: Why is Spotify Less Popular in Korea?

While Spotify dominates the US music streaming market, it only holds approximately 2% of the South Korean market. Possible reasons include:

- Late Market Entry: Spotify launched in Korea in 2021, and its free tier was introduced only in 2023.

- Strong Local Competitors: Platforms like Melon, Genie, and YouTube Music have a strong foothold.

- Cultural & Industry Factors: K-pop streaming strategies differ, as entertainment companies tailor promotional tactics across various platforms.

## Business Problem: Why Does This Matter for Streaming Platforms?

Understanding regional music trends is crucial for global streaming platforms like Spotify to:

- Improve Personalised Recommendations: Suggest relevant songs and artists based on location and listening habits.

- Optimise Marketing Strategies: Identify which artists and genres to promote in each country.

- Guide Licensing and Acquisitions: Decide which artists, albums, or labels are worth investing in for different markets.

- Enhance Content Curation: Create region-specific playlists to increase user engagement.

## Objective: Comparing Music Trends in South Korea & USA

This project will use Spotify's Top 50 charts from South Korea and the USA to:

- Identify local hits vs. globally popular tracks.

- Analyse artist distributions per country.

- Compare popularity scores of artists across both regions.

- Visualise data for actionable insights.

## Solution: Data-Driven Insights for Music Trends

### Step 1: Data Collection

Use the Spotify API to fetch the Top 50 charts for the US and South Korea.

Extract relevant details: song name, artist, popularity score, release date, album, and track duration.

### Step 2: Data Analysis and Visualisation

Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualisation techniques (e.g., bar charts, KDE plots), we will compare:

- Track Overlap: Which songs appear in both countries vs. exclusively in one?

- Artist Dominance: Which artists appear more frequently in each country's charts?

- Artist Popularity: Do US and Korean artists have different popularity scores?

- Release Trends: Are Korean charts more focused on newer songs?

- Album, Track Duration, and Release Date Comparison.

### Step 3: Business Recommendations

- For Spotify Korea: Strategies to grow its market presence in Korea.

- For Advertisers: Insights on music marketing based on regional preferences.

## Conclusion

Music consumption is not the same in every country. By comparing Korean and US playlists, we gained insights into which genres, artists, and trends are more popular in each country. This helps Spotify to create more targeted strategies for content curation, advertising, and user acquisition.
